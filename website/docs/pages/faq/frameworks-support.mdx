title: Support for other frameworks ?

We already have dozens of templates built in, you can found in [here](../available-templates), and are actively expanding the framework templates built into DID Connect, so in theory, Blocklet can be used in conjunction with any framework.

If you would like to add a framework to DID Connect, please [contact us](https://github.com/ArcBlock/did-connect/issues), or submit your [pull request](https://github.com/blocklet/) directly and we will add it as soon as possible.
