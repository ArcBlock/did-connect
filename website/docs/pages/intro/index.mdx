This is where you will learn everything about DID Connect.

## What is DID Connect?

DID Connect is an open protocol and development kit for connecting users and decentralized applications designed and implemented based on the W3C DID standard.

- The open protocol defines the problem to be solved, the data format and the basic flow, as detailed [here](/protocol).
- The development kit provides a set of components to integrate DID Connect into applications to meet different business needs, see [here](/developer).

If you are a developer, please take a moment to understand the [workflow](/intro/workflow) of DID Connect before integrating it into your application.

## Curious about what DID is?

The ArcBlock DID documentation site is under construction and will include the process of creating a DID and how to encode and decode it.

This site will only cover documentation related to DID Connect.
